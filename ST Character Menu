Plans
Use the empty rom slot Done
More Character Palettes atleast 2 for each character reason for a menu
	(Maybe more? depends if anyone else wants to do my original plan was 6 new colors but 6*16 = 96)

Menu after selecting character instead of old character cheat(if this fucks up playable akuma doubt any one will care)
	Actual Sprite Displayed
	(after selection to hide it for people who boot it up for the first time?)
 
Palette Select
 
Old Character selection
 (Doing this means old characters will have access to new palettes and vice versa (Should it?)
 
 *Maybe Match up
 (not from the board itself)
 
 What to do with the portrait?(Lazy way would be to just use one color)

Palette format will stay the same but will have string right before them
